name: Mushroom and wild rice soup
servings: 6
ingredients:
  - 1/4 cup olive oil
  - 1 large yellow onion
  - 3 celery stalks
  - 1 green bell pepper
  - 10 garlic cloves
  - 1 tbsp miso paste
  - 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
  - 1 tsp sweet paprika
  - 1 tsp onion powder
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp cayenne
  - 500g dried red kidney beans
  - 3 dried bay leaves
  - 3 fresh thyme sprigs
  - 1 tsp soy sauce
  - 225ml wild rice
steps:
  - Turn on the saut√© setting on the electric pressure cooker. Melt the butter, then add the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.
  - Add the mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add the celery, carrot, chopped garlic, thyme, garlic powder and several generous grinds of black pepper. Stir to combine.
  - Add the flour and stir until the vegetables are evenly coated and no white spots remain.
  - Pour in the stock and lemon juice, and turn off the heat.
  - Scrape the bottom of the pot very well to incorporate flour and any browned bits that are stuck to the bottom. (This will add flavor and also prevent a burn warning later.)
  - Stir in the wild rice.
  - Cook on high pressure for 10 to 12 minutes.
  - Turn off the heat and let the pressure reduce naturally for 10 minutes, then release the remaining pressure manually.
  - Stir the soup and check the texture of the wild rice; if it needs a bit more time repeat the pressure cooking process for a cook time of 2 minutes and rapidly release the pressure.
  - Put the sour cream in a small bowl and slowly whisk in a few spoonfuls of warm soup until smooth, then stir the mixture into the soup. (This prevents the sour cream from separating.) Taste the soup and add salt and pepper to taste.
  - Serve the soup in bowls topped with chopped scallions or chives and dill.
